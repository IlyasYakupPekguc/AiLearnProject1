Hello, this a fresh start to my AI coding journey. The goal of this journey is to learn about AI and learn as much as possible while doing projects from YouTube. (source down below)

Contents of the readme:
1- How and what the goal exactly is of my journey.
2- Notes i take while learning , and notes about the code
3- my thoughts about the project at the end of the project and what i plan to do next 

1-----------------------------------------
The goal explained in details:

First of all i'm a second grade student at Gazi University. I want to see what ai is about and learn more about the subject. This is my official second project about ai. my first
experience was within a compition named Teknofest. Agter gaining interest in AI i'm willing to learn more about this topic and i think the best way to do that is through projects. 
So this is my first YouTube based project. While learning i also intend to get a fuller GitHub page. So that's a double win-win. After finishing the project i intend to continue the
YouTube playlist if it apeals to me and my goals.
